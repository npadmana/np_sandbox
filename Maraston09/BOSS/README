Hi Nikhil,


please find calculations


at www.maraston.eu/BOSS/models_Molly_Claudia.tar.gz


for passive LRG models and SF models for several stellar masses and redshifts.


You will find several files, e.g.


mags_redshift_M09.M1e10


refers to calculations for 10^10 Msun for the passive LRG model (M09). Here files only differ for stellar mass.


In the SF case, there are two sets of files, which either include dust reddening or not.


They are called e.g.


mags_redshift_csptau10gred.M1e10: constant SF model including reddening


mags_redshift_csptau10gnored.M1e10: the same without reddening


again for several masses.


The header is the same for every file, namely:


M*/Msun             z         t/Gyr       Mu          Mg           Mr          Mi            Mz           u              g             r             i              z
  .1000E+11    0.4100   0.0010  -23.3856  -23.3570  -23.4013  -23.3266  -23.2236   18.3457   18.3744   18.3300   18.4048   18.5078



  It's all AB, so you just subtract mags and get colours


  The same files named 'fnezgrid' are models calculated for a denser z grid within CMASS.


  Please, let me know if you have troubles.
